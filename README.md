![timestamp_pg1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dd751a9-51c4-435d-a97c-12179bc40314)


## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Average Waiting Time (AWT)** of patients at government healthcare facilities in Bihar, India. Leveraging **SQL** and **Power BI**, the dashboard uncovers operational inefficiencies, highlights best-performing doctors and facilities, and supports data-driven reforms for the **Bihar Health Application Visionary Yojana**.

---

## Problem Statement

Bihar, one of India's most populous states, relies heavily on public healthcare. Overcrowding often leads to long patient wait times, impacting care quality and satisfaction. This project addresses the need to monitor and optimize waiting times for better healthcare delivery.

---

## Data Source

- **Bhavya Central Application Database:** An internal healthcare system aggregating timestamped OPD data from government hospitals statewide.

---

## Methodology

**Tools Used:**
- MySQL (for data extraction and preprocessing)
- Power BI (for data modeling, analysis, and dashboard creation)

**Techniques:**
- SQL for data cleaning, joins, and transformation
- DAX for AWT computation and advanced categorization
- Power BI slicers and filters for interactivity

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Average Waiting Time (AWT)** of patients at government healthcare facilities in Bihar, India. Leveraging **SQL** and **Power BI**, the dashboard uncovers operational inefficiencies, highlights best-performing doctors and facilities, and supports data-driven reforms for the **Bihar Health Application Visionary Yojana**.
